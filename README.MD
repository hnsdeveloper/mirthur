# Mirthur

Mirthur is a scripiting language intended to be used with the Bevy game engine. It is still on it's infancy (it doesn't have a formal grammar yet), and features will be added as needed for development while using the Bevy game engine. For now it is not usable, as I am still developing the parser and virtual machine for it.
